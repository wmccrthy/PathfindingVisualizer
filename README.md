# PathfindingVisualizer
Program built in Python with pygame to visualize pathfinding algorithms. *IN PROGRESS*
Currently supports A*, Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, and Uniform Cost Search. User can select starting node and target node from the grid and create walls. I plan to add functionality such that user can weight certain nodes to expand the variety of implemented algorithms visual manifestation.
