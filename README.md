# PathfindingVisualizer
*IN PROGRESS*
Program built in Python with pygame to visualize pathfinding algorithms. Currently supports A*, Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, and Uniform Cost Search. User can select starting node and target node from the grid and create walls. I plan to add functionality such that user can weight certain nodes to expand the variety of implemented algorithms visual manifestation. Program makes use of util.py, a file repurposed from UC Berkely's CS 188 Pacman Projects. util.py (as used in this project) simply implements LIFO, FIFO, and Priority Queues.
