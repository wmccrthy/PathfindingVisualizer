# PathfindingVisualizer
*IN PROGRESS*
Program built in Python with pygame to visualize pathfinding algorithms. Currently supports A*, Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, and a Random Search. User can select starting node and target node from the grid, create walls and press m to autogenerate mazes (this is not working precisely as intended yet). I plan to add functionality such that user can weight certain nodes. Program makes use of util.py, a file repurposed from UC Berkely's CS 188 Pacman Projects. util.py (as used in this project) simply implements LIFO, FIFO, and Priority Queues.
